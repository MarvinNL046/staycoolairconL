# Summary of Changes to the ContactWebhook Form

## Problem
The contact form with Make.com webhook integration had three main issues:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP) blocked connections to Make.com**
   - The browser blocked connections to the Make.com webhook URL due to CSP restrictions
   - Error message: "Refused to connect to 'https://hook.eu1.make.com/...' because it violates the Content Security Policy directive"

2. **No active Make.com scenario**
   - The webhook URL was valid, but there was no active scenario in Make.com listening to this webhook
   - Error message: "There is no scenario listening for this webhook"

3. **CSP also blocked Google Analytics/Ads tracking**
   - After the first fix, connections to Google services were also blocked
   - Error messages for googleadservices.com and google.nl/pagead

## Solutions

### 1. Updated CSP in vite.config.ts
- Added Make.com to the connect-src directive:
  ```
  https://*.make.com
  ```
- Added Google services to script-src and connect-src directives:
  ```
  script-src: https://*.googleadservices.com https://www.google.com
  connect-src: https://*.google.nl https://*.googleadservices.com
  ```
- Applied the same CSP changes to both server and preview sections

### 2. Modified ContactWebhook component
- Added simulation mode to simulate form submissions without actually calling the webhook
- Added better error handling with specific error messages
- Improved logging to facilitate debugging

### 3. Updated ContactWebhookTest page
- Added a warning banner informing users that the form is in simulation mode
- Added clear instructions about activating the webhook

## How to Activate for Production
To make the form fully functional in production:

1. Create a new scenario in Make.com that listens to the webhook URL
2. Configure the scenario to process the received data (e.g., send emails, store data)
3. Once the scenario is active, remove the simulation code in ContactWebhook.tsx:
   - Remove the comment markers around the fetch call to the webhook
   - Remove the simulation code

The CSP changes ensure that the browser allows connections to Make.com and Google services, which are necessary for both webhook and analytics functionality.
